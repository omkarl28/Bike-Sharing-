# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

- We are planning to use Multiple linear regression to build a model for this business

- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- The Company wants to know:
  Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- <p style='background-color:#04AF70;padding:10px;color:white'>Temprature is a major factor with increase in temprature the demand also increases</p>
- <p style='background-color:#04AF70;padding:10px;color:white'>The Months of July August and Sep has high demand so should be considered</p>
- <p style='background-color:#04AF70;padding:10px;color:white'>Demand increases duriung fall, should be prepared for high demand</p>
